# Building Successful Deployments Workshop

AppOps, short for Application Operations is a practice being developed by DigitalOcean Engineers to prescribe a course of actions needed to move a project from development status to production status. This course will walk its participants through the AppOps steps.

Starting with continuous integration, we’ll reflect on the importance of having an automated process to determine if a particular code commit is able to be included in a production release. Differences between automated test running and artifact building will be highlighted.

After you have an artifact, where does it go? The next item, continuous deployment will be discussed. Having a robust and repeatable deployment method reduces fears and failures at deploy time.

When the application is running on servers, you’ll require insights into how it is operating. How do we get past viewing logs on the servers and to a single place where we can visualize everything at once.

Logging details a large part of how your application is working, but what are metrics and error handling? In this section, we’ll add tools, which will allow us to get a comprehensive view of how our application is working.

Finally, we’ll discuss potential requirements for modern applications and how they can best fit in modern cloud infrastructures.
